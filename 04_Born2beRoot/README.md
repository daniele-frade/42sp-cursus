>This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.
<br>


## ✅ Mandatory part

This project consists of having you set up your first server by following specific rules:

- You must choose as an operating system either the latest stable version of Debian or the latest stable version of Rocky.
- You must create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM. Below is an example of the expected partitioning:

## ⭐ Bonus

You don’t have to do all the bonuses. Considering this, I only implemented the first part.

- Set up partitions correctly so you get a structure similar to the one below:

- Set up a functional WordPress website with the following services: lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP.
- Set up a service of your choice that you think is useful (NGINX / Apache2 excluded!).
