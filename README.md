## 42 School

[42](https://www.42network.org/) is a renowned programming school that offers a unique and intensive learning experience and follows a peer-to-peer learning model, where students engage in collaborative and project-based learning without traditional teachers or lectures, at no cost. The curriculum focuses on practical programming skills and problem-solving abilities, with a strong emphasis on self-directed learning and hands-on projects. 

The 42 cursus is available to those who are accepted through its selection process. The "Piscine", a 26-day immersion in C programming, serves as the final phase of the selection process to become a student at 42.

For additional information regarding 42's selection process, known as "Piscine," please visit the website [42sp](https://www.42sp.org.br/) or [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/).

## Projects

The list below presents the projects performed during the Cursus in chronological order.

| Project  | Status | Evaluation | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| [Libft](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/01_libft)                 | Finished <br> August 11, 2023 | <br>125/100 | This project is the first project as a student at 42. It is about coding a `C library`. It will contain a lot of general-purpose functions your programs will rely upon. | 
| [Get_Next_Line](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/02_get_next_line) | Finished <br> August 27, 2023 | <br>125/100 | This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor, stdin, or even later a network connection.  It will be a good start to know what a `static variable` is. |
| [Printf](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/03_printf)               | Finished <br> September 11, 2023 | <br>110/100 | This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode `printf` from `libc`. You will learn what is and how to implement `variadic functions`. |
| [Born2beRoot](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/04_born2beroot)     | Finished <br> September 28, 2023 | <br>110/100 | This project aims to introduce the wonderful world of `virtualization`. You will create your first `virtual machine` in VirtualBox with your own `operating system` under specific instructions. |
| [So_Long](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/05_so_long)     | Finished <br> November 11, 2023 | <br>100/100 | This project is a small 2D game with minilibx. You'll learn about textures, sprites and tiles. |
| [Minitalk](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/06_minitalk)     | Finished <br> November 15, 2023 | <br>125/100 | The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. |
| [Push_Swap](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/07_push_swap)     | Finished <br> December 08, 2023 | <br>84/100 | This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. |
| [Minishell](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/08_minishell)     | Finished <br> June 28, 2024  | <br>   101/100 | This project is about creating a simple shell, your own little bash. |
| [Philosophers](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/09_philosophers)     | Finished <br> July 14, 2024  | <br>   100/100 | This project is about threads.You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes. |
| [NetPractice](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/10_net_practice)     | Finished <br> July 27, 2024  | <br>   100/100 | This project is a general practical exercise designed to help you discover networking. |
| [Cub3D](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/11_cub3d)     | Finished <br> October 17, 2024  | <br>   100/100 | This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. |
| [Inception](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/12_inception)     | Finished <br> October 18, 2024  | <br>   100/100 | This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. |
| [irc](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/13_ft_irc)     | Finished <br> April 09, 2025  | <br>   100/100 | Create your own IRC server in C++, fully compatible with an official client. |
| [cpp](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/14_cpp)     | Finished <br> July 20, 2025  | <br>   100/100 | Master C++ to develop high-performance applications, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for modular, reusable, and scalable software design. |
| [Transcendence](https://github.com/daniele-frade/42sp-cursus/tree/main/15_transcendence)     | In Progress <br> August, 2025  | <br>    | This project is centered around the design, development, and organization of a full-stack web application. |
