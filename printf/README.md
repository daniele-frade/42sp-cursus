# ft_printf

This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version of `printf` from libc. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions.

### ✅ Mandatory part

You have to implement the following conversions:

- `%c` Prints a single character.
- `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- `%i` Prints an integer in base 10.
- `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- `%%` Prints a percent sign.

### ⭐ Bonus

You don’t have to do all the bonuses. Considering this, I only implemented the first part.

- Manage all the following flags: `’# +’` yes, one of them is a space.
- Manage any combination of the following flags: `’-0.’` and the field minimum width under all conversions.
